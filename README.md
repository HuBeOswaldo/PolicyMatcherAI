# 🤖 PolicyMatcher AI

> **Autonomous AI Agent for Intelligent Matching of Insurance Policy Data**

## 📌 Project Summary

PolicyMatcher AI is an autonomous agent designed to **match entries across multiple data sources** related to insurance policies. It helps businesses reconcile transactions, assign premium payments, and track policy lifecycle events by identifying the most likely match in a master table.

This project aims to reduce manual effort, increase precision in data reconciliation, and lay the foundation for real-time matching capabilities in future versions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an AI-driven matching agent capable of:
- Identifying which policy record (Table A) corresponds to a given transaction or event (Table B)
- Improving over time through supervised learning
- Interacting with internal databases (and future APIs)
- Operating autonomously in the background with potential for real-time performance

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

1. **Premium Matching**  
   Link payment transactions to their corresponding policies.

2. **Lifecycle Event Matching**  
   Map policy events (activation, cancellation, renewal) to the right policy records.

3. **Financial Reconciliation**  
   Cross-check transactions between internal and external systems.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the matching agent, the following metrics will be used:

- **Accuracy**  
  The percentage of correctly matched records compared to the total number of evaluated records.

- **Top-K Accuracy**  
  Measures whether the correct match appears within the top K predictions (e.g., top 3), useful for scenarios with multiple candidate matches.

- **Precision / Recall**  
  Especially useful for imbalanced datasets.  
  - **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)  
  - **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

- **F1 Score**  
  Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

- **Inference Time**  
  Time it takes to produce a prediction. Important for future real-time processing.

---

## 🧪 A/B Testing (Future Enhancements)

The following experiments are planned to validate the effectiveness of the AI matching system:

- Compare **heuristic-only matching** vs **ML-based matching** strategies.
- Run **manual vs automated** reconciliation experiments to measure time savings.
- Test different **feature sets** and **model architectures** to improve precision.
- Use **feedback loops** to continuously improve matching logic based on human validation.
