# 🤖 PolicyMatcher AI

> **Autonomous AI Agent for Intelligent Matching of Insurance Policy Data**

## 📌 Project Summary

PolicyMatcher AI is an autonomous agent designed to **match entries across multiple data sources (AL3 data base vs. ATM data base)** related to insurance policies. It helps businesses reconcile transactions by identifying the most likely match in the Atm Data.

This project aims to reduce manual effort, increase precision in data reconciliation, and lay the foundation for real-time matching capabilities in future versions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an AI-driven matching agent capable of:
- Identifying which policy record (AL3) corresponds to a given transaction (ATM)
- Improving over time through supervised learning
- Interacting with internal databases (and future APIs)
- Operating autonomously in the background with potential for real-time performance

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

1. **Intelligent Premium Matching (AL3 ↔ ATM)**  
   Automatically identify the most probable match between an AL3 policy record and a transaction in the ATM database, even when data fields are not identical.

   - Match based on:
     - Policy number
     - Effective date
     - Transaction date
     - Premium amount
     - Transaction type
   - Uses a scoring system to weigh similarities across fields and choose the best candidate.
   - Handles common edge cases, such as swapped dates or partial premium mismatches.

3. **[Planned] Financial Reconciliation Module**  
   Future extension that will apply the same intelligent matching logic to reconcile **payment transactions across Agencytrak vs.Atlas**.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the matching agent, the following metrics will be used:

- **Accuracy**  
  The percentage of correctly matched records compared to the total number of evaluated records.

- **Top-K Accuracy**  
  Measures whether the correct match appears within the top K predictions (e.g., top 3), useful for scenarios with multiple candidate matches.

- **Precision / Recall**  
  Especially useful for imbalanced datasets.  
  - **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)  
  - **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

- **F1 Score**  
  Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

- **Inference Time**  
  Time it takes to produce a prediction. Important for future real-time processing.

## 🧪 A/B Testing (Future Enhancements)

The following experiments are planned to validate the effectiveness of the AI matching system:

- Compare **heuristic-only matching** vs **ML-based matching** strategies.
- Run **manual vs automated** reconciliation experiments to measure time savings.
- Test different **feature sets** and **model architectures** to improve precision.
- Use **feedback loops** to continuously improve matching logic based on human validation.
